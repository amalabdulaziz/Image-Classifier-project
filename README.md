# Image-Classifier-project
Image Classifier
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications.
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.
This is the final Project of the Udacity AI with Python Nanodegree.
